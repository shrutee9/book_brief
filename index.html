				<h2><a href="books.html">Book Review: Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to lead by Sheryl Sandberg</a></h2>
				<p>
					As the world is still reeling from the Women’s Day celebrations, glowing social media
tributes to women around us, and special offers and discounts by brands and restaurants it
makes one wonder, do women really want gifts and chocolates? Women’s day was not
supposed to be Black Friday sale 2.0, this day was meant to create awareness about women’s
issues and talk about challenges faced by women, instead of trivialising the gender by
offering discounts on supposedly “girly” products and grocery as women still battle
Victorian-era mentality and continue to fight for the most primitive and basic rights.
While women have the right to equality on paper as there is a <a href="https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/" target="_blank"> convention on the elimination
of all forms of discrimination against women,</a> in reality, women are discriminated against
both at home and at work which is evident from the pay gap as women earn <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/discrimination/womens-rights/">77% of what
men do for the same work</a> according to Amnesty International and women do not hold
enough positions of power as only <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/leadership-and-political-participation/facts-and-figures" target="_blank"> 25% of parliamentarians today are women across the
world</a> according to UN Women.<br><br>
In light of gender equality, which remains an elusive goal across the globe, especially amidst
the  <a href="https://www.worldatwork.org/workspan/articles/covid-19-s-impact-on-the-gender-wage-gap" target="_blank">ongoing pandemic which threatens to make the gender pay gap wider,</a> the book Lean In:
Women, Work and the Will to lead written by Facebook COO, Sheryl Sandberg has become a
massive cultural phenomenon in recent times and a catchphrase to empower women. The
book reignites conversation about women in the workplace and the institutionalised gender
bias affecting their careers. Through Lean In Sandberg sets out to share her experiences and
insights to inspire women around the globe to quite literally “lean in” to their lives and
careers.<br><br>
The overarching theme of this book is that despite all the progress women have made,
especially in surpassing men in university graduation rates, they are still paid less compared
to men in equal positions and hold a disproportionately low number of top-ranking jobs. It
combines Sandberg’s career trajectory, personal anecdotes, compelling research and hard
data to change the conversation from what women can’t achieve to what they can.
In addition to this, the book also includes useful studies about how women apply for open
jobs when they feel they meet 100 percent of the requirements, whereas their male
counterparts apply for the same jobs when they think they meet only 60 percent of the
requirements. Such studies and results leave the readers with a lot of food for thought as they
mull over these facts. The author provides advice, mentorship and negotiation techniques for
building a successful career. She shares steps women can take to combine personal
satisfaction with professional achievement and reveals how men can gain by supporting
women at home and in the workplace.<br><br>
More importantly, Sandberg comes across as not only tough but also as honest, likeable,
compassionate and funny. Through her writing, she is willing to highlight her own
insecurities while trying to encourage other women to be fearless. She addresses the self-
doubt that holds back most women by writing, “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?”
She urges her readers to constantly ask themselves: “What am I doing that I don’t know?”,
“How can I do better?” and her book is full of such motivating gems and questions. She also
asks some really important questions that make you wonder whether this dearth of women in
top positions is due to the lack of support or lack of ambition. She not only answers this
particular question but also encourages women to “wage battles on both fronts.” The book also sheds light on how likability and success are positively correlated for men whereas they
are negatively correlated in the case of females— a phenomenon that we witnessed in the
media coverage as well, as more women considered presidential bids in the past year.
Other than writing about how women should take charge of their own careers and push
forward at a time when gender bias is more prevalent than we would like to admit, Sandberg
also focuses on the difficulties women face to raise a child while working hard and reflects
on her first-hand experiences as well. She makes various points throughout her book about
the barriers women face, and ways to mitigate them. Her advice can broadly be categorized
into three takeaways- women must sit at the table, “lean in” to their endeavours to
accomplish their goals and seek challenges.<br><br>
While the book focuses on women who wish to build a career for themselves, it’s not
a guide on how to climb their career ladder. In fact, Sandberg insists that in this era
there is no ladder to climb, and that one must look at their career as a jungle gym
instead – bouncing from one great opportunity to the next. It is not necessarily a &quot;how-
to&quot; book, giving women a quick fix on how to become great leaders, but more of a book on
how to recognise certain behaviours, characteristics and traits that both women and men
possess and their impact on women in the workplace. Therefore Sandberg brings a lot of
these important yet under-recognised and under-discussed topics to the table.
Lean In revolves around issues like equal pay and thus the deeply ingrained gender bias in
our society which affects women and their careers. I strongly believe that this book paints an
accurate picture of the situation at hand because even though the book was published in 2013
it continues to be relevant in today’s day and age since women are waging battles against
issues such as unequal pay and institutionalized gender discrimination even in today’s
society. Aspects of Lean In such as the idea of women advocating for themselves at home
and work, championing their ideas and projects, and negotiating unapologetically for better
benefits and salaries continue to hold value in 2021 as well. I strongly recommend this book
as it’s carefully researched based on how sexism still pervades the workplace and the
highlight of this book was the author’s willingness to admit and share her own self-doubt and
failures, which makes it easy for readers to relate to her.<br><br>

Even though the book is written by one of Fortune’s 50 Most Powerful Women and for the
most part addresses women in the US workforce, it transcends cultures and borders as it
proves to be valuable to the debate of gender inequality in the South Asian workplace context
as well. While most books about gender inequality revolve around what needs to change
culturally, institutionally and socially, Lean In’s framework focuses on what women can do
to address these internal and external barriers that hinder their success. This is a refreshing
approach because instead of waiting passively for other members of society to address issues
of inequality, this book urges women to “lean in”— to take charge, claim spaces that are
rightfully theirs, to be ambitious and provides concrete suggestions and ideas that would
allow women to achieve their true potential.<br><br>
If you enjoyed reading Lean In, I would strongly urge you to read similar books such as Nice
Girls Don&#39;t Get the Corner Office: 101 Unconscious Mistakes Women Make That Sabotage
Their Careers by Dr Lois P. Frankel and Feminist Fight Club by Jessica Bennett. The first book is very similar to Lean In as it also focuses on women’s behaviours that make
them self-sabotage their careers such as working non-stop without allowing themselves to
take a break, worrying about offending or upsetting other people, explaining too much when
asked a question, backing down too easily, or asking for everyone’s opinion before making a
decision. She explains in her book that women who show such “girlish behaviour” are
usually not considered for promotions and are unable to climb the ladder of success as their
careers progress. Dr Frankel discusses a unique set of behaviour she has spotted that women
learn in girlhood that leads to stagnation in their careers. She helps her readers get rid of these
unconscious mistakes that hold them back and shares valuable tips (just like Sheryl
Sandberg) one can incorporate into their business and social skills. She suggests her readers
to change these behaviours say “girl” instead of “woman” to be seen as a powerful woman
who knows how to occupy the corner office by getting better career opportunities.
The second book, Feminist Fight Club is similar to Lean In in terms of its focus on sexism in
the workplace and how to overcome it. According to the author, Jessica Bennett if a woman
has been doing the same job for long enough she tends to become disillusioned by workplace
sexism. This book is “a survival manual for sexist workplace” and provides women with
practical tips to support one another and change sexist workplace cultures. In the book,
Bennett coins various humorous new terms such as insidious undermine-her (someone who
calls women around the office kiddos or girls) and bropropriation (when a man presents a
woman’s idea as his own without giving her due credit).<br><br>
While these books may not revolutionize the deep-set gender stereotypes in our
patriarchal society, they are certainly a step in the right direction; a step we must
collectively take as a community on our journey towards a more equal world.
